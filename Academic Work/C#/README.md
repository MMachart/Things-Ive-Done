`RegisterApp` is a Windows Desktop app written in C# that takes user input for the customer's order total as well as the amount of money tendered for payment. The app will accept positive numbers with a maximum of 2 decimal places. The tender amount is required to be greater than the transaction total to ensure the change total is positive. After clicking the `CALCULATE CHANGE` button the app returns the total change that should be returned to the customer as well as a breakdown of the minimum number of coins to make the change.
