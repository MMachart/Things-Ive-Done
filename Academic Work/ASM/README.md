The files within this repo are examples of work that was done in a course titled "Computer Organization". All projects were completed using x86 assembly language. 

Microsoft Macro Assembler and Microsoft Visual C++ were te tools used for development in this course.

`AsmBinarySearch.asm` was written to compare how long a binary search would take if written in x86 ASM vs C++.
